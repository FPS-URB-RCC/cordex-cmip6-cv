# CORDEX-CMIP6 Controlled Vocabulary (CV) for use in FPS-URB-RCC

This is a fork of the [CORDEX-CMIP6 CV](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cordex-cmip6-cv) to develop CV for the [FPS-URB-RCC](https://ms.hereon.de/cordex_fps_urban).

You can check differences with the base CORDEX-CMIP6 CV for dynamical downscaling [here](https://github.com/impetus4change/cordex-cmip6-cv/compare/main..fpsurbrcc).
